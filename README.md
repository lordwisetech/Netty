# Netty - Networking Web App

Netty is a modern networking web application built using Django and JavaScript. This project allows users to connect, manage posts, and interact with other users. Itâ€™s designed to offer an interactive and engaging experience while also making it suitable for desktop and laptop use (currently not optimized for mobile devices).

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Create Posts**: Users can create and share posts.
- **Follow Other Users**: Users can follow others to stay updated with their content.
- **Saved Posts**: Users can save posts for later viewing.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has their own profile where they can manage their information.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for desktop and laptop users (mobile optimization is currently in progress).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
